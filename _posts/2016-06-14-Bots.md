List of (Twitter) bots I've made (in chronological order):

- [@gvillejunk](https://twitter.com/gvillejunk) - items posted to the
  Gainesville, FL Craigslist "free" section.
- [@hmmdarwin](https://twitter.com/hmmdarwin) - Markov bot trained on the major
  works of Charles Darwin.
- [@harib0t](https://twitter.com/harib0t) - Hare Krishna mantras.

I thought I had a lot more bots when I set out to write this blog post.
