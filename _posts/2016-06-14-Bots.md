I really like bots. Here's a list of Twitter bots I've made:


1. [@gvillejunk](https://twitter.com/gvillejunk) - items posted to the
  Gainesville, FL Craigslist "free" section.
2. [@hmmdarwin](https://twitter.com/hmmdarwin) - Markov bot trained on the major
  works of Charles Darwin.
3. [@meowhector](https://twitter.com/meowhector) - Bot about my cat.
4. [@harib0t](https://twitter.com/harib0t) - Hare Krishna mantras.

I thought I had a lot more bots when I set out to write this blog post.

[Here's](https://twitter.com/heyaudy/lists/bots) a much bigger list of bots by
other people.
