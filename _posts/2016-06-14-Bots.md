I really like bots. Here's a list of Twitter bots I've made:

- [@new_taxonomies](twitter.com/new_taxonomies) - tweets whenever there is an
  update to the NCBI taxonomy database
- [@gvillejunk](https://twitter.com/gvillejunk) - items posted to the
  Gainesville, FL Craigslist "free" section.
- [@hmmdarwin](https://twitter.com/hmmdarwin) - Markov bot trained on the major
  works of Charles Darwin.
- [@meowhector](https://twitter.com/meowhector) - Bot about my cat.
- [@harib0t](https://twitter.com/harib0t) - Hare Krishna mantras.
- [@cappstories](https://twitter.com/cappstories) - True stories from Capp
   St., SF. Made using [Cheap Bots Done Quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/)
   and [Tracery](http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html#).
- [@pizza_dolores](https://twitter.com/pizza_dolores) - in dedication to my
   favorite Dolores Park vendor.
- [@every_omics](https://twitter.com/every_omics) - Random 'Omicses

[Here's](https://twitter.com/heyaudy/lists/bots) a much larger list of bots
that were created by other people.
