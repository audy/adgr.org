## I took a picture of an Illumina plate (using QSEQ files)
 
Illumina sequencer output (QSEQ format) contains reads, quality scores and the
X/Y coordinates from the cluster they came from.

I was curious if certain parts of an Illumina plate have lower quality reads
than others. So, I decided to draw a map of an Illumina plate using these
coordinates and the average quality score for that read.

In the first image, a white pixel corresponds to the presence of a sequence at
a coordinate:

You can see a subtle border between the eight lanes but not much else.

In the second image, I used two colors: Green for average quality scores above
99% (good) and Red for below (bad). This way, approximately half of the
clusters are red and half are green.

I did this using the Python Image Library and Python.  You can see the
[code](https://gist.github.com/955875) on GitHub.
